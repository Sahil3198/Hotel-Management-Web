        At Continental, our passion is to connect our guests to the very best of our destinations.
        Our hotels offer guests extraordinary places, created by combining unique architecture and structure, expressive decor and artistry, and magnificent features. Add great service, and the result is an unforgettable guest experience.
        Many of our hotels were among the first buildings to be erected in young cities across India; in these places, we can boast that our communities literally grew up around us. Today, we have added many modern city-center properties to our collection.
        Make Continental your personal gateway to exploring the world’s most extraordinary places—and to having your most memorable experiences.
